## Development
Development of this plugin is being made on Linux so the bash scripts in the project wont work on windows.
- `release.sh` updates the version of the plugin and builds the release archive
- `build-dev.sh` builds an archive of the plugin and places it in the temp plugin folder for Openplanet
